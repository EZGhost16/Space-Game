As this is a class project, I did not write the header files nor proj4.cpp as those were provided as starter code. I provided those files anyways, because they're needed to run the rest of the code or at the very least give context as to all the other files.
However, I did write everything else as noted by all the header comments in the .cpp files. 
I also understand how to write the files that I didn't do, so I'd be able to replicate something similar, or maybe even better, if I need to. 
The main file to run is proj4.cpp and everything else is connected.
